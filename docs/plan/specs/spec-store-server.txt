Component:	Storeserver
Summary:	Prepares output from Spider for storage in Repository
Input:		doc id, stats/metrics and doc contents from Spider
Output:		Same as input, except document is in compressed form
Issues:		* This component will be CPU-bound
			* Compression speed/efficiency

Detailed account of operation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The storeserver merely takes input from the spider (docID, url length,
document length, url, document, etc.), which it then forms into a compressed
"packet," for storage in the repository.  

The storeserver will use the same protocol as the spider and the repository,
so that code should be implemented in a common file to avoid code duplication.

We parse the document out of the input, compress it, then copy the rest of the
input verbatim to the repository for storage

Why the storeserver? To seperate the CPU-intensive task from the I/O
intensive Spider and the disk-intensive Repository.
