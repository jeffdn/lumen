General Component Intercommunication Protocol Guidelines

In an effort to standardize intercommunication between components, we here specify
guidelines for said communication. 

Guidelines:

    ALIGNMENT
    
        Protocol should be 8-byte aligned where possible, so that no
        <=8 byte fields are split across 8-byte boundaries. This allows
        better parsing performance on 32 and 64 bit computers. Also, smaller
        fields should be grouped together where possible.

    BITFIELDS

        Use of bitfields should be minimized, and where unavoidable, should be
        grouped together so as to simplify porting to architecures of varying
        endianness


Octet(s) 

0       Status Code         Whether or not an operation succeeded, and why/why not
1       Component Type Id   What type of component sent this message
2-3     Instance Id         Every running component should have an ID for tracking purposes
4-7     Msg Len (octets)    

?       Component/Msg-specific data

Fields

    Status

        Code    Name            Meaning
        0       OK              No error
