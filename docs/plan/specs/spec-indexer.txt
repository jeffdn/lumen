Each "hit" is essentially a word, the word's position in the web page, the its
font size, and capitalization.  When someone searches for a certain query, all
the aforementioned factors come into play when determining the page's
relationship with the query string.  The hits are placed into a forward
index... <-- find out more about that

The index also takes URL that are parsed out of web pages and places them
into anchor files.  These anchor files contain what page the URL linked from,
where it links to, and the text of the link (<a href=...>text</a>).  The URL
resolver takes the URL's from the anchor files, converts them into document
ID's, and then inserts the document id of the page linked from and the page 
linked to into a links database.  This database is used for the pagerank
system... <-- mmm, pagerank
